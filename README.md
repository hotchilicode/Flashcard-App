# Flashcard Creator

A simple JavaScript project that allows users to create, view, and manage flashcards.

## Description

This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a flashcard creator application. Users can create new flashcards by entering a question and answer, and the application will store them in local storage. The flashcards are displayed on the page, and users can click on them to reveal the answer. The application also includes features to delete all flashcards and toggle the visibility of the create card box.
